# LucaPetrescu-products-app

I finally finished the app. Did all the required(almost) stuff in the e-mail. 
The only things that gamed me headaches were the edit pop up menu and the creating of the two Docker containers. However, that doesn't mean I haven't tried.
Tried to create a separate component for the edit pop-up and also created the two Docker containers, or at least their images. But i didn.t know 
how to configure the MongoDB database in the docker-compose file.

However, I am pretty proud of what i did.
